# Cache Simulator for MET CS 472
Second project for MET CS 472 - Computer Architecture taken in spring 2024. A writeback direct-mapped cache simulation was implemented exactly as the assignment's requirements specified.

The two tests provided in the assignment, the first being the reading test with the provided cache contents, along with the second "real" test with no known output, are in `readtest.txt` and `fulltest.txt` respectively. The output of both tests are in `output.txt`, and the output of the first reading test match the assignment instructions exactly.

**Update:** This scored 100%.
